# Getting Started

In this exercise, you will perform the basic setup to get a SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) project created and ready for further development.</br>

## Is HANA running?

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rT-PEUg8Uw&t=20s)</br>
In the [trial landscape](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/) the HANA instance stops each night. Therefore the first thing we need to do is make sure your HANA instance is running.

1. From the SAP Cloud Platform entry page, click **Subaccounts** and then the tile for your Subaccount named **trial**
</br>![Subaccount](/exercises/ex0/images/subaccount.png)

1. Then click on your **dev** space to navigate to the space level. </br>![Space select](/exercises/ex0/images/space_select.png)

2. In the left side menu choose **SAP HANA Cloud**. You should see your instance listed. If not, please return to the [Requirements](../../README.md#Requirements) and follow the steps for "Create an instance of the SAP HANA Cloud in your trial account"</br>![HANA Cloud Instance](images/3_2.png)

3. We can no longer see the status of our instance from this screen. In order to check the status or perform other management tasks, please click the **Manage HANA Cloud** button.<br>![Manage HANA Cloud](images/manage_hana_cloud.png)
   
4. The SAP HANA Cloud Databases tool will open in a new browser tab. If your instance is stopped, the status in the first column of the list will state that.</br>![Status Stopped](images/status_stopped.png)

5. To restart the instance if it stopped, simply click on the Actions button and then  **Start** button. It takes a few minutes and you will have to press the refresh button to check on the progress. You do NOT have to wait while your HANA instance restarts. You can continue on with the subsequent steps and check back on the status in a few minutes.</br>![Instance Stopped](images/start_me.png)

6. Double check, using the edit option from this same action menu to access the instance's settings, that the "Allow all IP addresses" option is selected for the **Allowed connections** setting.</br>![Edit Settings](images/settings_edit.png)</br></br>![Accessing the instance settings](images/advanced_settings.png)

## Creating Business Application Studio Dev Space

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rT-PEUg8Uw&t=297s)</br>
Dev spaces are like isolated virtual machines in the cloud that can be quickly spun-up. Each dev space type contains tailored tools and pre-installed run-times for a target scenario such as SAP Fiori or mobile development. This simplifies and saves time in setting up the development environment as thereâ€™s no need to install anything or upgrade; letting developers focus on their business domain, anytime, anywhere.

1. Go to your SAP Cloud Platform subaccount and click the **Subscriptions** option.</br>![Subscriptions](images/01-01%20SCP%20Subscriptions_.jpg)

2. Locate the **SAP Business Application Studio** tile and click **Go to Application**</br>![Go To Application](images/go_to_application.png)

3. Choose **Create Dev Space**. Please **NOTE**: In the SAP Cloud Platform trial you are limited to only two Dev Spaces and only one can be active at a time. If you have performed other workshops, you might already have reached your maximum. In that case you might have to delete one of the other dev spaces in order to continue with this workshop. </br>![Create Dev Space](images/AppStudio%20Dev%20Space%20Manager_.jpg)

4. Enter **HANA_DAT160** for your dev space name and choose **SAP Cloud Business Application** as the kind of application you are creating.</br>![Create Dev Space](images/create_dev_space.png)

5. The Dev space will automatically be configured with the most common tools you need for the type of application you choose. However you can also choose additional, optional extensions.  For this workshop we would ask that you also choose **CDS Graphical Modeler**, **SAP HANA Calculation View Editor**, **SAP HANA Database Explorer**, **SAP HANA Tools**.</br>![Optional Tools](images/optional_tools.png)

6. Once all selections are completed, press **Create Dev Space**</br>![Press Create Dev Space](images/press_create_dev_space.png)

7. The Dev Space will then begin starting and the process will take a minute or so as your cloud environment is being created</br>![Staring Dev Space](images/dev_space_starting.png)

8. Once the Dev Space reaches the green status of **RUNNING**, you can click on the name of the Dev Space and it will load into the editor within your browser</br>![Dev Space is Running](images/dev_space_running.png)

9. You'll be redirected to your newly created SAP Business Application Studio Dev Space. We recommend you bookmark this URL so it's easier for you to access this dev space of your SAP Business Application Studio in the future </br>![Business Application Studio is running](images/fully_running.png)

## Configuring Business Application Studio Dev Space

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rT-PEUg8Uw&t=526s)</br>
Before we create our SAP Cloud Application Programming Model project, we want to do a few more one-time configuration steps to prepare the Dev Space

1. In the bottom left of the Business Application Studio you will see a message that your Organization and Space are not set yet. Click this message to begin supplying your trial connection details</br>![Org and Space Not Set](images/cf_not_set.png)

2. The command window will then open at the top of the Business Application Studio. The first input will prompt you for the API endpoint</br>![API Endpoint](images/api_endpoint.png)

3. The default value proposed is likely the correct value, but if you need to confirm; the value can be found in the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit at the Subaccount level </br>![Finding the API Endpoint](images/api_endpoint_from_subaccount.png)

4. Press **Enter** to confirm your input of the API endpoint. The next input field will ask you for the email address you used to create your SAP Cloud Platform trial account </br>![Email](images/email.png)

5. The next input will ask you for your SAP Cloud Platform trial account password </br>![Password](images/password.png)

6. The next input will ask you for your Organization. In most situations you will have a single choice. But like the API endpoint earlier, if you need to confirm the correct value it will be displayed in the top navigation of the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit </br>![Organization](images/organization.png)

7. The final input will ask you for your Space. If you choose the endpoint API and Organization correctly, then you should have a single option of **dev** </br>![Space](images/space.png)

8. Upon completion of all the inputs, you should see that the Organization and Space have been set and you will see the values in the Targeting... dialog at the bottom left of the Business Application Studio </br>![Set Correctly](images/org_space_set_correctly.png)

## Summary

Your HANA instance should be running and you've created a Dev Space and configured it for your needs in the Business Application Studio. You are now ready to begin development.
